    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Marsala is a succulent dish that features thinly sliced pieces of pan-fried chicken breast and mushrooms in a reduced wine sauce. 
        Its name comes from the fortified Italian wine used to give the dish its trademark deep, nutty, and slightly sweet flavor.</p>
